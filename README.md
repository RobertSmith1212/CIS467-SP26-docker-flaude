# Hardening a Containerized Static Site (Flaude) with nginx

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lab, students will be able to:

1. Serve a static site from a custom nginx Docker container
2. Incrementally apply and verify server-side configurations
3. Use `curl` and browser DevTools to observe and validate HTTP behavior
4. Explain the purpose and tradeoff of each configuration decision
5. Write a minimal but production-realistic `nginx.conf`

---

## Lab Setup

### Project Structure

```
CIS467-SP26-docker-flaude/
├── Dockerfile
├── README.md
├── nginx.conf
├── index.html
├── src/
│   ├── app.js      
│   └── style.css
```

### Base Dockerfile

Students start with this and do not modify it — all changes happen in `nginx.conf`:

```dockerfile
FROM nginx:alpine
COPY site/ /usr/share/nginx/html/
COPY nginx.conf /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
EXPOSE 80
```

### Rebuild Helper

You can use this command throughout the lab to build and run your image:

```bash
docker build -t flaude-nginx . && docker run --rm -p 8080:80 flaude-nginx
```

---

## Checkpoint 0 — Baseline (Just Serve Files)

### Goal
Confirm the site loads before any custom configuration is applied.

### nginx.conf

```nginx
events {}

http {
    include /etc/nginx/mime.types;

    server {
        listen 80;
        root /usr/share/nginx/html;
        index index.html;
    }
}
```

### Verification

```bash
curl -I http://localhost:8080/
```

**Expected:** `200 OK`, no special headers, no compression.

### 0.1 - Reflection Question
> What headers does nginx send by default? Are any of them surprising?
> I didn't know what ETag was so I looked it up. 
> 
> According to Claude: An ETag (Entity Tag) is an HTTP response header used for cache validation. It's a unique identifier — typically a hash or fingerprint — that represents a specific version of a resource.

```
Server: nginx/1.29.5
Date: Wed, 11 Mar 2026 18:21:54 GMT
Content-Type: text/html
Content-Length: 19820
Last-Modified: Wed, 11 Mar 2026 17:47:24 GMT
Connection: keep-alive
ETag: "69b1aaac-4d6c"
Accept-Ranges: bytes 
```

---

## Checkpoint 1 — Compression

### Goal
Reduce asset transfer size for text-based files using gzip.

### Changes to `nginx.conf`

Add inside the `http` block:

```nginx
gzip on;
gzip_types text/plain text/css application/javascript application/json;
gzip_min_length 1024;
```

### Verification

```bash
curl -I -H "Accept-Encoding: gzip" http://localhost:8080/index.js
```

Look for: `Content-Encoding: gzip`

```HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: nginx/1.29.5
Date: Sun, 15 Mar 2026 20:20:52 GMT
Content-Type: text/html
Last-Modified: Fri, 13 Mar 2026 19:13:25 GMT
Connection: keep-alive
ETag: W/"69b461d5-4f7b"
Content-Encoding: gzip
```

Also verify in browser DevTools → Network tab → select a JS or CSS file →
check the **Response Headers** panel.

### 1.1 Reflection Question
> Why does `gzip_min_length` exist? What's the cost of compressing a 200-byte file?

>It exists to compress files that are bigger than 1000mb. The cost of compressing a 200 byte file, wouldnt really be that extreme, since our gzip_min_length already covers 200 byte files.

---

## Checkpoint 2 — Cache Control

### Goal
Apply appropriate caching strategies: aggressive caching for fingerprinted assets,
no caching for HTML entry points.

### Changes to `nginx.conf`

Add inside the `server` block:

```nginx
# HTML — always revalidate
location ~* \.html$ {
    add_header Cache-Control "no-cache, must-revalidate";
}

# Fingerprinted assets — cache for 1 year
location ~* \.(js|css|png|jpg|woff2|mp4)$ {
    add_header Cache-Control "public, max-age=31536000, immutable";
}
```

### Verification

```bash
curl -I http://localhost:8080/index.html
curl -I http://localhost:8080/My_Differential_Equation.mp4
```

Confirm different `Cache-Control` values on each response.
```
Index:
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: nginx/1.29.5
Date: Sun, 15 Mar 2026 21:12:22 GMT
Content-Type: text/html
Content-Length: 20347
Last-Modified: Fri, 13 Mar 2026 19:13:25 GMT
Connection: keep-alive
ETag: "69b461d5-4f7b"
Cache-Control: no-cache, must-revalidate
Accept-Ranges: bytes
```
```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: nginx/1.29.5
Date: Mon, 16 Mar 2026 21:45:39 GMT
Content-Type: video/mp4
Content-Length: 4767395
Last-Modified: Mon, 16 Mar 2026 18:20:57 GMT
Connection: keep-alive
ETag: "69b84a09-48bea3"
Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable
Accept-Ranges: bytes
```

### 2.1 - Reflection Question
> Why would caching `index.html` aggressively be dangerous for a single-page app?
> Constantly caching index.html will be saved everytime you build, if you try to build with a old index.html cache then youll break your website.
> What would happen if a user's browser cached a stale `index.html` pointing to
> old JS bundles?
> The browser will keep requesting the old cache breaking the website.

---

## Checkpoint 3 — Security Headers

### Goal
Protect users from common browser-level attacks by adding standard security headers.

### Changes to `nginx.conf`

Add inside the `server` block (or a dedicated location):

```nginx
add_header X-Frame-Options "SAMEORIGIN";
add_header X-Content-Type-Options "nosniff";
add_header Referrer-Policy "strict-origin-when-cross-origin";
add_header Permissions-Policy "geolocation=(), camera=(), microphone=()";
add_header Content-Security-Policy
    "default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'; style-src 'self';";
```

### Verification

```bash
curl -I http://localhost:8080/
```

All five headers should appear in the response.

Also check: https://securityheaders.com (enter `http://localhost:8080` if using
a tunneling tool, or deploy to a VPS for full scoring).

### 3.1 - Reflection Questions
> Break the CSP intentionally — add an inline `<script>` tag to `index.html`
> and observe the browser console error. What does this teach you about
> how CSP is enforced?
>The browser stops the inline tag from being executed. It shows that CSP enforces protection at the browser level.

---

## Checkpoint 4 — SPA Routing Fallback

### Goal
Ensure that client-side routes (e.g., `/dashboard`, `/profile/42`) return
`index.html` instead of a 404, allowing JavaScript frameworks to handle routing.

### Setup

Add a link in `index.html` to a route that has no corresponding HTML file:

```html
<a href="/dashboard">Go to Dashboard</a>
```

Without the fallback, clicking this returns a 404.

### Changes to `nginx.conf`

Replace or update the default `location` block:

```nginx
location / {
    try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
}
```

### Verification

```bash
curl -I http://localhost:8080/dashboard
```

**Expected:** `200 OK` with the content of `index.html` — not a 404.

Also add a custom 404 page to handle truly missing assets:

```nginx
error_page 404 /404.html;
```

### 4.1 - Reflection Questions
> If every route returns `index.html` with a 200, what are the SEO implications?
> How do SSR frameworks like Next.js solve this problem?

> It means that response codes are meaningless, making it harder to focus on what is breaking the website.

> Next.js sends rendering to the server, which gives you control over what gets sent.

---

## Checkpoint 5 — Rate Limiting

### Goal
Protect the server from abusive request patterns using nginx's built-in
rate limiting directives.

### Changes to `nginx.conf`

Add to the `http` block:

```nginx
limit_req_zone $binary_remote_addr zone=general:10m rate=10r/s;
```

Apply it in the `server` block:

```nginx
limit_req zone=general burst=20 nodelay;
limit_req_status 429;
```

### Verification

Use a loop to fire rapid requests:

```bash
for i in $(seq 1 30); do curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}\n" \
  http://localhost:8080/; done
```

Some responses should return `429 Too Many Requests` once the burst is exhausted.

### 5.1 - Reflection Question
> Rate limiting on a static site might seem overkill — when would it actually
> matter in production?

>If someone wanted to take your site down, rate limiting would protect it from bad actors flooding the site with requests.

---

## Checkpoint 6 — Block Sensitive Paths

### Goal
Prevent accidental exposure of configuration files, version control artifacts,
or environment files that might exist in the container.

### Changes to `nginx.conf`

```nginx
location ~ /\. {
    deny all;
    return 404;
}

location ~* \.(env|git|yml|yaml|config)$ {
    deny all;
    return 404;
}
```

### Verification

```bash
# Create a test file to block
echo "SECRET=abc123" > site/.env

# Rebuild and test
curl -I http://localhost:8080/.env
```

**Expected:** `404` — not the file contents.

### 6.1 - Reflection Question
> Why return `404` instead of `403 Forbidden`? What information does each
> status code leak to an attacker?

>Returning a 404 instead of a 403 doesnt give a attacker any information. It just makes it look like a broken website, and not somthing holding secrets.

## Final nginx.conf

You should have a complete, working config. Review it as a whole and identify any ordering issues or redundancies.

---

## Deliverable: Written Reflection (Individual)

Submit a short written response (200-500 words) answering the following:

1. Which configuration had the most visible impact when you verified it? Why?
2. Choose one header or directive you added. Research what a real-world attack
   looks like that it mitigates, and describe it briefly.
3. What does this lab reveal about what managed hosting platforms like Netlify
   are silently doing on your behalf?

> 1. The configuration that had the biggest impact was the .env protection config. Making sure that my .env file is save and all of the secrets inside are safe is what had a impact on me.
> 2. The rate-limiter config was interesting. Something like the rate-limiter being different across devices suprised me and put into perspective how differnt devices can deal with spam attacks.
> 3. It shows how much they do in the background. Making sure sites are secure, and are protected from attacks is one of the more obvious things, but also sites compressing files, and making your site run smoother was something I also thought of.
